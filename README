Instructions on how to run multi-agent simulations.

Modify the following paths in the following files to your preferred destination:

mylogging.py ---> line 5, 7, and 9.

simulation_functions.py ---> line 10.

agent.py  ---> line 624, 628, 643, 651, 657. (these are the files with the final results which will be visualized later)

The following directory structure is assumed:

~/catkin_ws/src/GITagent

To run:

./run.sh

The simulations will run for ten agents.

In order to run the dynamic case, all agents dynamic ---> in line 71, change to if self.ID > 0

In order to run the static variant:

scripts/aboutme_wm.py --> keep as is

In order to run 1 dynamic agent, rest static ---> in line 71, change to if self.ID == 1. Agent with ID one will be dynamic.

In order to visualize results as heatmaps, run the following in the folder where the output results files from the simulation are saved:

First generate the compressed results files for depend tasks, and dropped tasks.




./handle_results.py filename_for_depend_values depend

./handle_results.py filename_for_drop_values drop
